# 🔐 LockIt – A Simple Password Manager
LockIt is a full-stack password manager,It allows users to add, view, and manage their saved passwords securely — no login, no encryption.
I have created two versions of this one version is **Localstorage(LockIt)** and the other is using database like **MongoDB(LockIt-Mongo)**.
