# 🔐 LockIt – A Simple Password Manager

LockIt is a lightweight, front-end password manager built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to add, view, and manage their saved passwords securely within the browser using **localStorage** — no backend, no login, no encryption.

> ⚠️ For personal experiments or learning purposes only — not intended for production or storing real credentials.
